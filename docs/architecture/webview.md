# Webview Vrs Electron

The following document contains the findings and decision for the migration from electron to Webview.

Here are the notes from the first meetings for reference.

#### Notes: June 13 2019

Note that `feature` is to conclude in a `go/no go` decision on moving off of Electron and onto Webview. In the event that it has impacts on the release of V1, this roadmap will be updated.

Although security is the primary objective for this feature, we must also look at the impacts of autoupdating the system.
