Write your key down.

Or, encrypt your key in a password protected file.
Plan a strategy for the physical storage of your private key. This storage strategy should include long term thinking, including:
Physical Security: Vaults of any kind that provide the protection you are seeking. Think of somewhere you know is safe from theft as well as the elements. some examples are a home or bank safe, or lawyer. you may choose to protect your keys by storing copies in multiple places.
Legacy: Things happen. Life ends. You need to plan for the transference of your wallet to someone else. In some cases that may be a will, please consider your options carefully. The choice is yours.
